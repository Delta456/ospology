## Objectives

1.	Identify the role of open source management in driving security, innovation, and collaboration within `{industry/technology}` ecosystems
2.	Explore solutions and best practices for leveraging open source management to optimize `{industry/technology}` infrastructures
3.	Facilitate knowledge sharing among participants to address challenges and uncover opportunities for growth

## Structure

### Part 1: Opening and Context (10 Minutes)
   
A project manager introduces the session objectives, emphasizing the role of open source management in the `{industry/technology}` ecosystem. Key themes include:
- Security: How open source management ensures and sustains secure practices in `{industry/technology}`
- Innovation: Open source management’s role in fostering innovation and accelerating technology adoption in `{industry/technology}`
- Collaboration: Bridging diverse teams (e.g, security, development, operations) through open source practices within `{industry/technology}`

### Part 2: Participant Introductions (10 Minutes)

- Attendees briefly share their expertise and involvement with `{industry/technology}` and open source ecosystems
- Assign 2 facilitators to guide discussions. Divide participants into `{number}` groups

### Part 3: Framing Challenges Using “How Might We” Questions (20 Minutes)

Participants generate “How Might We” questions to identify key challenges and opportunities. Examples:

- How might we strengthen security practices in `{industry/technology}` using open source strategies?
- How might open source managers help organizations adopt innovative tools and frameworks in `{industry/technology}`?
- How might open source management improve collaboration between security and DevOps teams in `{industry/technology}`?

Each participant writes 1–3 ideas on sticky notes (one idea per note)

### Part 4: Affinity Mapping (10 Minutes)
- Participants group similar ideas and form clusters. Label clusters to reflect common themes (e.g how open source management contributes to {key themes such as security practices, collaborative frameworks, governance in `{industry/technology}`}).
- Participants vote on the top two clusters for further exploration.

### Part 5: Final Remarks (10 Minutes)
Assigned Facilitators summarize findings and key insights with participants


### Part 6: Virtual Follow-Up (Asynchronous)
A project manager compiles and publishes final results, including:
- A report capturing session insights and recommendations.
- Outcomes added to relevant open source documentation (e.g [OSPO Book Chapter](https://ospobook.todogroup.org/)).
- Publish results within the agreed timeline (e.g `{timeline, such as Q2 2025}`).
