This report aims to identify and address challenges faced by organizations to manage open source and foster cloud-native adoption in India, providing recommendations

## Methodology

A mixed-methods approach was employed to ensure a holistic view of the issues and identify recommendations:

- Interactive Group Activity: An in-person Birds of a Feather (BoF) session was conducted during the OSPOlogy event at KubeCon + CloudNativeCon India 2024 in New Delhi. Approximately 30 participants, including security teams, cloud engineers, open source managers, and community leaders, engaged in discussions to identify and prioritize challenges specific to the Indian market. 
- Asynchronous Collaboration: Following the BoF session, participants continued to collaborate asynchronously to develop recommendations and cross-reference existing work. Participants of the BoF who expressed interest are acknowledged as co-authors.
- (Optional) Stakeholder Interviews: Interviews conducted with representatives from Indian organizations that have active OSPOs to gain insights into their backgrounds and the challenges they face.
