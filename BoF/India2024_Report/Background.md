# Background

India’s market in 2024 is marked by a strong inclination towards digital transformation. The Indian technology industry’s revenue, including hardware, is projected to surpass US$254 billion in FY2024, reflecting a 3.8% year-on-year growth.  This growth is fueled by the increasing adoption of open source and cloud-native technologies, which are pivotal in driving innovation, agility, and cost efficiency. This trend is more remarkable in the following areas:

## Cloud Expansion and Adoption of Cloud-Native Architectures

The Indian cloud market is witnessing unprecedented growth, with projections indicating a 24% increase in adoption across various sectors, including government, healthcare, retail, supply chain, logistics, manufacturing, and financial services.
This surge is attributed to the flexibility, scalability, and cost-effectiveness of cloud-native solutions, enabling organizations to innovate rapidly and respond swiftly to market demands.

Digital Native Businesses in India are increasingly adopting cloud-native modular architectures built around microservices. This approach allows independent operation and communication through APIs, enabling rapid scaling and meeting rising customer digitalization demands. The estimated growth rate for tech spending on cloud-based solutions is 37%, surpassing non-cloud software and IT services.

## Open Source Software Adoption

### Global Adoption and Perceived Benefits

According to the 2024 Global Spotlight Insights Report by the Linux Foundation, 79% of respondents affirm that the open source development approach leads to greater software quality. The perceived industry benefits reported in driving OSS adoption are Innovation, Standards and Interoperability and Productivity

### Regional Insights

The 2024 Global Spotlight Insights Report indicates that a significant percentage of organizations in North America and Europe openly encourage both the use and contribution to open source projects. Despite the widespread usage adoption, contributors often face challenges such as time constraints (63% identify lack of time) and funding limitations (34% identify insufficient funding) from their organizations and governments. In light of this, a notable proportion of organizations have established Open Source Program Offices (OSPOs) or have clear and visible strategies to support OSS initiatives.

On the other hand, in the Asia-Pacific region, the engagement with OSS is slightly lower compared to North America and Europe. However, the report highlights a positive trend, with increasing numbers of organizations adopting OSS principles and encouraging contributions. 
 
### India’s Ascending Role in the OSS Ecosystem

Within this global context, India has emerged as a significant player in the OSS landscape. The country has witnessed a substantial increase in both adoption and contribution to open source technologies. As of 2024, India hosts over 17 million developers on GitHub, marking a 28% year-over-year growth. Projections indicate that by 2028, India will surpass the United States to become the largest developer community on GitHub.

## Government Initiatives and Investments

The Indian government’s commitment to digital transformation is evident through substantial investments in cloud infrastructure and artificial intelligence (AI). In 2024, the Indian government has intensified its focus on cloud-native technologies through the Open Cloud Compute (OCC) Initiative. This initiative aims to create an open and interoperable marketplace for cloud providers of all sizes, challenging the dominance of major global players. By utilizing open protocols and standards, the OCC seeks to provide cost-effective and flexible cloud solutions, fostering innovation and reducing dependency on foreign providers.

Moreover, the Ministry of Electronics and Information Technology (MeitY)  introduced the “Policy on Adoption of Open Source Software for Government of India,” mandating that all government software applications and services be built using Open Source Software (OSS). However, implementing this policy has been challenging. There have been instances where government agencies have issued tenders for proprietary software, even when OSS alternatives are available. For example, in 2024, the National Highways Authority of India (NHAI) floated a tender to procure proprietary products.

The government had announced plans to unveil a new national IT policy by the end of 2024, aiming to update the previous 2012 policy with a stronger focus on creating and exporting IT products and services. However, as of now, the policy has not been released, and there have been no official updates on whether it is still in progress.
