# Discovered Challenges in the India Market

As India’s digital market continues to embrace open source and cloud-native technologies, several challenges have emerged that require strategic attention. These challenges can be categorized into the following key areas:

## Security

The vast number of downloads and integrations increase the attack surface, making it imperative to address vulnerabilities promptly. The 2024 State of the Software Supply Chain report highlights the unprecedented challenges posed by this rapid expansion, emphasizing the need for comprehensive security measures.

## Starting and Structuring Open Source Management Units

Establishing and structuring dedicated Open Source Management Units has become essential for organizations to effectively navigate the complexities of their open source engagements. 
The establishment of Open Source Program Offices (OSPOs) has become a chosen pattern for establishing Open Source Management Units adopted by numerous organizations.

The 2024 State of OSPOs and Open Source Management report highlights how the establishment of OSPOs showed effective integration from a growing number of organizations of open source 
management in two key specializations: security and AI infrastructure. Notably, 91% of OSPOs are involved in managing security issues, and 84% are engaged in overseeing Generative AI 
(GenAI) infrastructure. Additionally, 80% of organizations report that their OSPOs have a meaningful impact on their ability to collaborate with open source communities.
