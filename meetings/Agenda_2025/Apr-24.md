### Guest Presentation Details

TOYOTA's OSPO was established in January 2024. Over the past year, we have visualized the communities that interest engineers within the company and the automotive industry. Based on this, we have identified key activities to focus on and have worked to revitalize these activities. In this session, I will summarize our activities in 2024 and introduce our plans for 2025.
