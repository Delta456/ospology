## OSS for Business Whitepaper Roadmap

More Context for reviewing purposes.\
Contributors working on the OSS in Business Whitepaper will require a roadmap that will provide additional guidance, establish an estimated timeline and track milestones achieved overtime. This roadmap will be made publicly accessible and linked to the readme.md and Contribution.md files.\
The roadmap file will entail the following details in a structured format with tag of group leads responsible for specific sections.\
Suggested format: 
 <summary><h2> Engineering Driven vs Business Driven in Open Source </h2></summary>
 
- Overview
- Engineering Driven Projects
- Business Drvien Projects
- Comparisons
- Conclusions
   > Started: 12th January || To be Completed: 20th January || Lead by: @harmonyelendu.


With this structure there will be clear direction for everyone invloved, including the public while serving as a progress check for various groups, group leads and the working group. At the end ensuring a successful completion of the OSS in Business Whitepaper within an estimated timeline.\

Please note: I'm available for more information or clarity if needed.
